REMUS

A map reduce pipeline engine.

For more detailed documentation, go to https://github.com/kellrott/Remus/wiki


Remus is web oriented database founded pipeline engine. It 
is comprised of a series of key/value stacks that are 
linked together by set operations. 

There are two primary components:

1) The master server: is handles job coordination, assigning
work to the worker nodes in an orderly fashion.  It also provides 
a primary web based interface to all of the data.

2) The worker process: these processes check in the master
asking for work assignments. They then execute the requested code 
and return results.


INSTALLATION


1) Download and Install Cassandra
Download Page
http://cassandra.apache.org/download/

Getting Started Page:
http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted

After configuration, run ./bin/cassandra to start the Cassandra database.

2) Download Remus
Remus can be downloaded at https://github.com/kellrott/Remus 

REMUS_DIR is the downloaded directory, and should have a ‘README’ file, a ‘bin’ folder, and an ‘etc’ folder. 

3) Build:
make

3.1) Cassandra Enabled Python Client

The remus client will work without these libraries, but having them makes data access much faster:

easy_install pycassa
easy_install thrift05


4) Server properties file:

Edit the ‘etc/remus.prop’ file to setup your custom parameters. 

Example Server Properties:

org.remus.port = 16017
org.remus.mpstore = org.mpstore.ThriftStore
org.remus.attachstore = org.mpstore.FileAttachStore

org.mpstore.FileAttachStore.dir = /opt/remus
org.mpstore.FileAttachStore.shared = true

org.mpstore.ThriftStore.columnFamily = remusTable
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.keySpace = remus
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.instColumns = false

org.remus.workManage = org.remus.manage.PassiveManager


Properties Definitions:

org.remus.port - Define the Internet Port Remus should live on
org.remus.mpstore - Define the driver Remus should use to store Map/Reduce related key-pair values  
org.remus.attachstore - Define the driver Remus should use to store File attachments

org.mpstore.FileAttachStore.dir - Define a directory to hold file attachments
org.mpstore.FileAttachStore.shared - The file attachment directory is a shared folder accross worker machines

org.mpstore.ThriftStore.server - The host where the Cassandra instance lives (default: localhost)
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.port - The port to contact the Cassandra server (default: 9160)
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.keySpace - The Cassandra keyspace to be used by the ThriftStore driver
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.columnFamily - The Cassandra column family to be used by the ThriftStore driver


5) Server Startup
To start the master server, in REMUS_DIR run ./bin/remusMaster

6) Load site
Point your web browser to the server, for example: http://localhost:16017/@manage/
