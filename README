For more detailed documentation, go to https://github.com/kellrott/Remus/wiki

Remus is a Python directed pipeline engine. As computations occur, results are
stored in a series of key/value stacks (with binary attachements).

INSTALLATION

cd python && python setup.py build && python setup.py install

Running unit tests

After build:

cd tests && python ./run_tests.py


To run with DRMAA support:

pip install http://drmaa-python.googlecode.com/files/drmaa-0.5.tar.gz

(if you don't have root access use 'install --user')

And then set the environmental variable to the local DRMAA library, ie:

export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gridengine/lib/lx26-amd64/libdrmaa.so
