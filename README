REMUS

A map reduce pipeline engine.


Remus is web oriented database founded pipeline engine. It 
is comprised of a series of key/value stacks that are 
linked together by set operations. 

There are two primary components:

1) The master server: is handles job coordination, assigning
work to the worker nodes in an orderly fashion.  It also provides 
a primary web based interface to all of the data.

2) The worker process: these processes check in the master
asking for work assignments. They then execute the requested code 
and return results.
