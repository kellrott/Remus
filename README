REMUS

A map reduce pipeline engine.


Remus is web oriented database founded pipeline engine. It 
is comprised of a series of key/value stacks that are 
linked together by set operations. 

There are two primary components:

1) The master server: is handles job coordination, assigning
work to the worker nodes in an orderly fashion.  It also provides 
a primary web based interface to all of the data.

2) The worker process: these processes check in the master
asking for work assignments. They then execute the requested code 
and return results.


INSTALLATION


1) Download and Install Cassandra
Download Page
http://cassandra.apache.org/download/

Getting Started Page:
http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted

After configuration, run ./bin/cassandra to start the Cassandra database.

2)Download Remus
Remus can be downloaded at https://github.com/kellrott/Remus 

REMUS_DIR is the downloaded directory, and should have a ‘README’ file, a ‘bin’ folder, and an ‘etc’ folder. 

3) Server properties file:

Edit the ‘etc/remus.prop’ file to setup your custom parameters. 

Example Server Properties:

org.remus.port = 16017
org.remus.mpstore = org.mpstore.ThriftStore
org.remus.attachstore = org.mpstore.FileAttachStore
org.remus.workdir = /var/lib/remusWork
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.columnFamily = remusTable
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.keySpace = remus


Properties Definitions:

org.remus.port	Define the Internet Port Remus should live on
org.remus.mpstore	Define the driver Remus should use to store Map/Reduce related key-pair values  
org.remus.attachstore	Define the driver Remus should use to store File attachments
org.remus.workdir	Define common directory for Remus files
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.server	The host where the Cassandra instance lives (default: localhost)
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.port	The port to contact the Cassandra server (default: 9160)
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.keySpace	The Cassandra keyspace to be used by the ThriftStore driver
org.mpstore.ThriftStore.columnFamily	The Cassandra column family to be used by the ThriftStore driver


4) Server Startup
To start the master server, in REMUS_DIR run ./bin/remusMaster

5)Load site
Point your web browser to the server, for example: http://localhost:16017/@manage/
